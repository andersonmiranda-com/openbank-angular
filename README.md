## Openbank-angular

This is the Angular version of a 3 steps wizard with form validation, backend simulation and translation to EN/ES.

### Instructions:

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### TODO:

- Translation using i18n
